# Typeface Backend Assignment (Dropbox service)

## Project Overview:

This project implements a simplified Dropbox-like service that allows users to upload, retrieve, update, delete, and list files through a set of RESTful APIs. The service is built using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF), providing a robust and scalable solution for file management.

## Features:

- Upload File: Users can upload files, which are stored in the server's file system, and their metadata is saved in a SQLite database.
- Read File: Users can retrieve files based on their unique identifiers.

- Update File: Users can update existing files and their metadata. When a new file is uploaded, the old file is deleted from the server to prevent orphaned files.

- Delete File: Users can delete specific files based on their unique identifiers, which also removes the file from the server's file system.

- List Files: Users can list all available files along with their metadata.

## File Storage:

- Files are stored in the media/ directory of the project. When a user uploads a file, the file is saved in this directory, and its metadata (including the file name, size, type, and path) is stored in the SQLite database.

- When a user updates a file, the old file is deleted from the server's file system before saving the new file. Similarly, when a file is deleted, it is removed from both the database and the file system.

## Technologies Used:

- Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

- Django Rest Framework (DRF): A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.

- SQLite: A lightweight database for storing file metadata.

- Python: The programming language used for developing the application.
